        <h2>Dark Mode</h2>
        <h1>Put your best work forward.</h1>
        <p>Dark Mode is a dramatic new look that helps you focus on your work. The subtle colors and fine points of your content take center screen as toolbars and menus recede into the background. Switch it on in System Preferences to create a beautiful, distraction-free working environment that’s easy on the eyes — in every way. Dark Mode works with built-in apps that come with your Mac, and third-party apps can adopt it, too.</p>

        <h2>Dynamic Desktop</h2>
        <h1>A desktop whose time has come.</h1>
        <p>Customize your work environment with a time-shifting desktop picture that changes to match the time of day wherever you are. Your Mac is now an even more beautiful place, all day long.</p>

        <h2>Screenshots</h2>
        <h1>Screenshots are now a snap.</h1>
        <p>With macOS Mojave, all the controls you need to grab any type of screenshot are one simple shortcut away. An easy-to-use menu includes new screen-recording tools and options like setting a start timer, showing the cursor, and even customizing where you’d like to save your screenshots. Take a screenshot and a thumbnail of it animates to the corner of the screen. Leave it there to automatically save it to the destination you’ve chosen. Or click it to mark it up and share it right away — without having to save a copy. It’s more than easy; it’s clutter-free.</p>
